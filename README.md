# An Ax to Grind: A Practical Ax Manual

This brief manual on the history and use of the ax was published by the USDA
Forest Service. It is available online as both [HTML][1] and [PDF][2]. As a
government publication, it is in the public domain.

Years ago I had printed out a hard-copy of the PDF that I kept in a binder.
Wanting to replace that with an e-reader friendly version, I have formatted the
text as Markdown, suitable for processing via [Pandoc][3].
