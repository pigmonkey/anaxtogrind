# Buying an Ax

## New and Used Axes

Acquiring a good ax is almost as difficult today as learning to use one properly. The majority of American ax manufacturers have gone out of business; only a few are left in the United States. A few ax companies in other countries, including Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand, still manufacture quality axes. I have found the steel and fit of imported Chinese axes to be of very poor quality. These are often sold as generic "no name" axes at discount outlets. Let the buyer beware.

Buying a quality used ax at a secondhand store, flea market, or farm auction may be your best bet. Most used axes are also abused axes, but about 1 out of 10 is still usable. The price is usually right. Used axes can often be picked up for half the cost of a new ax. Look not only at the ax's condition, but take the ax's manufacturer and its head pattern into consideration. The quality of steel and the tempering of old axes is often superior to that of new axes. The helve or the handle is not of any importance at this point. Shop only for the ax head and plan to rehang it to fit your needs.
