# About the Author

Bernie Weisgerber retired as a historic preservation specialist for the USDA Forest Service. He was in charge of the Northern Region's Historic Preservation Team, headquartered in Missoula, MT, from 1991. He worked for the National Park Service's Historic Preservation Training Center before coming to work for the Forest Service.

Bernie and his crew of skilled craftsmen restore historic Federal buildings, often at remote sites, using traditional technologies and materials. The team's projects often provide training opportunities for other Federal employees and the general public, as part of the Forest Service's Passport in Time and Heritage Expeditions programs. Weisgerber has twice been a guest craftsman on National Public Broadcasting's This Old House television series.
