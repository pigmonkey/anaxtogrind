# Acknowledgments

From the time this manuscript began as a series of audio tapes, *An Ax to Grind: A Practical Ax Manual* has benefited from a lot of assistance. I would like to thank the following Missoula Technology and Development Center staff and other Forest Service employees for their major contributions.

I would also invite you to look at the companion video program, *An Ax to Grind*. Parts 1 and 2 of the program are each 30 minutes long. Copies are available from MTDC at the following address:

Many of the photographs are of axes from Bernie Weisgerber's personal collection. Many of the illustrations were drawn by Frederic H. Kock for Bernard S. Mason's book, *Woodsmanship* (1954). The illustrations are used here by permission of Mrs. Frederic H. Kock.
